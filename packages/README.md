# Missing Packages
Certain packages necessary for the yubihsm-shell build process requires help2man and cmake. In the RHEL Repositories, help2man is not available so I had to download from source. As for cmake, the required version is not available in the RHEL Repo so I had to install the latest from source

* help2man
* cmake (Too large to upload to repo)
