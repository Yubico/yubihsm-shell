== YubiHSM Shell

This repository contains most of the components used to interact with
the YubiHSM 2 at both a user-facing and programmatic level.

The available components are:

- link:lib/README.adoc[libyubihsm] -- C library to expose low- and high-level functions to
  interact with a YubiHSM

- link:src/README.adoc[yubihsm-shell] -- thin wrapper around `libyubihsm` providing both
  an interactive and command-line interface to a YubiHSM

- link:pkcs11/README.adoc[yubihsm-pkcs11] -- PKCS#11 module using `libyubihsm`

- link:yhwrap/README.adoc[yubihsm-wrap] -- command-line tool to create encrypted objects (wraps) that can be imported in the YubiHSM

- link:ykhsmauth/README.adoc[libykhsmauth] -- C library for using the YubiKey HSM Auth application

- link:yubihsm-auth/README.adoc[yubihsm-auth] -- command-line tool to use the YubiKey HSM Auth application

=== Dependencies

- cmake
- cppcheck (optional)
- gcov and lcov (optional)
- gengetopt
- help2man (optional)
- libcrypto
- libcurl
- libedit
- libusb
- libpcsclite-dev

- pkg-config
- pre-commit

=== Documentation

Documentation for this project and the YubiHSM2 in general can be found on Yubico's https://developers.yubico.com/YubiHSM2/[developers website].

=== pre-commit

This repository uses https://pre-commit.com/[pre-commit].

 $ pre-commit install

=== Building

 $ mkdir build && cd build
 $ cmake ..
 $ make

Note that `ninja` builds are available as well:

 $ mkdir build && cd build
 $ cmake -GNinja ..
 $ ninja

The binaries will be located in `build` directory. To install them on the system, run `make install`. Note that this
step may require admin privileges on some systems (tex. `sudo` on Linux)

IMPORTANT: Building from source on Windows should be made with the source from the source release package and not
directly from the cloned repository. This is due to the `gengetopt` library not being available for Windows.

Manpages are built by default using `help2man`. It is possible to skip this step with:

 $ mkdir build && cd build
 $ cmake -DWITHOUT_MANPAGES=1 ..
 $ make

It is possible to build the libraries and binaries with static linking, this can be enabled with:

  $ mkdir build && cd build
  $ cmake -DENABLE_STATIC=1 ..
  $ make

=== Linting

There is a `cppcheck` target that runs the source through `cppcheck`

 $ make cppcheck

=== Testing

PKCS#11 tests can be run using https://github.com/Yubico/pkcs11test[pkcs11test].

The tool must be already built, and the path to the resulting binary
must be in your `PATH`, or `PKCS11TEST_PATH` must be set.

The programs found in the `/examples` directory are also used as tests.

The tests can be run via

 $ make test

Or using ctest directly

 $ ctest

By default the tests expect a local connector running at `http://127.0.0.1:12345`.
A different connector for the tests can be specified by setting the
`DEFAULT_CONNECTOR_URL` environment variable.
For example, to run tests using direct USB (i.e., without a connector) use

 $ DEFAULT_CONNECTOR_URL="yhusb://" ctest

If you are building `yubihsm-shell` with `ninja`, the following is available:

 $ ninja test

The test output can be found in `.../yubihsm-shell/build/Testing/Temporary/LastTest{,sFailed}.log`.

Direct command-line output can be obtained with

 $ ctest -V

==== Coverage

Code coverage is provided courtesy of lcov and https://github.com/RWTH-HPC/CMake-codecov[CMake-codecov]. This currently only works with `make` and not with `ninja`.

Enable coverage with

 $ cmake -DENABLE_COVERAGE=1 ..

You can then build the project normally and run some executables (for example running the tests with `make test`).

At this point coverage evaluation can be generated with gcov/lcov related targets. For example

 $ make lcov

will generate a single HTML report in `./lcov/html/all_targets/index.html`
