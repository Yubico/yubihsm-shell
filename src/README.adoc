== YubiHSM Shell

YubiHSM Shell is a tool to directly interface with a YubiHSM 2 device.

For the most part it is a thin wrapper around `libyubihsm` exposing
most of its functions directly to the user.

YubiHSM Shell can be invoked in interactive mode and from the command
line. Special (national) characters are supported on MacOS and Linux
platforms. On Windows, they are supported in interactive mode and the
same support can be activated through the OpenSSL environment variable
`OPENSSL_WIN32_UTF8` for interactive password entry in non-interactive
mode (i.e if password is not given on the command line). Such characters
will be encoded according to current locale settings on MacOS/Linux
(typically utf-8), and always as utf-8 on Windows.

=== Interactive Mode

To invoke YubiHSM Shell in interactive mode simply run `yubihsm-shell`
with no parameters. This mode supports tab-completion (not on Windows)
and "classic" terminal shortcuts (`C-p`, `C-n`, `C-a`, `C-e`, etc.)

In this mode, the default Connector URL is `http://127.0.01:12345`. If
a different URL is needed, it can be specified with the
`--connector` option. For example, to select direct USB run

[source, bash]
----
yubihsm-shell --connector yhusb://
----

Help can be obtained by running

[source, bash]
----
yubihsm> help
----

to get a list of available commands and their syntax, or by running

[source, bash]
----
yubihsm> help COMMAND
----

to get help on a specific command.

Debug messages can be turned on by running

[source, bash]
----
yubihsm> debug all
----

other levels of verbosity are available as well.

Each command has its own default input and output format. Possible
choices are `PEM`, `base64`, `binary`, `hex`, `password` and
`default`. Those can be changed by running

[source, bash]
----
yubihsm> set informat base64
----

or

[source, bash]
----
yubihsm> set outformat hex
----

Input and Output formats are a generic modifier and some values may not
make sense in some cases. The default setting can be restored by using
the `default` format.

=== Command-line Mode

It is possible to run yubihsm-shell as a non-interactive command-line
utility. To do so add the `--action` option with the desired command
to execute.

For example, to generate an RSA 2048 key with Label `Signature_Key`,
Object ID `10` and Capabilities `sign-pss`, run

[source, bash]
----
$ yubihsm-shell -p password -a generate-asymmetric -A rsa2048 -i 10 -c sign-pss -l Signature_Key
----

to sign a file called `message.dat` using the previously generated
key, PSS with SHA256 as padding scheme and save the result to a file
called `signature.dat` run

[source, bash]
----
$ yubihsm-shell -p password -a sign-pss -i 10 -A rsa-pss-sha256 --in message.dat --out signature.dat --outformat binary
----

it is then possible to extract the public key by using

[source, bash]
----
yubihsm-shell -p password -a get-public-key -i 10 --out key.pem --outformat PEM
----

and verify the signature with OpenSSL by running

[source, bash]
----
$ openssl dgst -sha256 -binary message.dat > digest.dat
$ openssl pkutil -verify -in message.dat -sigfile signature.dat -pkeyopt rsa_padding_mode:pss -pubin -inkey key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_pss_saltlen:-1 -pkeyopt digest:sha256
----

A detailed list of possible actions and parameters is available in the
manpage or by running `yubihsm-shell --help`.
